  <li><h2>New Uber Service Focus on Getting Folks to the Doctor</h2></li>
  <p>Uber on Thursday introduced Uber Health, a new service designed to provide reliable transportation specifically for healthcare-related needs. The program, which is currently in beta, will offer healthcare providers a way to order rides for their patients to help them keep their appointments.</p>
  <p>Uber Health addresses a growing problem, especially with seniors and others who lack good transportation options for visits to doctors or clinics.</p>

<p>As many as 3.6 million Americans miss doctor appointments due to lack of reliable transportation, suggests data from the Community Transport Association. This problem is especially troublesome for those with chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>The new Uber service is designed to provide a flexible ride schedule for both patients and caregivers. Rides can be scheduled immediately when needed -- much like the traditional Uber service -- but they also can be ordered up to 30 days in advance and scheduled along with follow-up healthcare appointments. There will be an option for providers to schedule multiple rides using a single dashboard.</p>
<p>Uber Health gets around the technology gap for low-income patients and seniors who do not own a smartphone, which typically is required to order a ride from Uber or a competing service. Uber Health rides can be ordered via text message instead of using an app, and patients also can receive ride information via a landline.</p>
<p>Uber Health currently is undergoing a beta test with more than 100 healthcare organizations in the United States. Early testers include hospitals, clinics, rehab centers, senior care facilities, home care centers and physical therapy providers. Adams Clinical, Manhattan Women's Health, NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center and Yale New Haven Health are among those participating in the test.</p>

<li><h2>Microsoft Gives Devs More Open Source Quantum Computing Goodies</h2></li>
<p>Microsoft this week announced the first major upgrade to its Quantum Development Kit since its introduction last year. It has added several new features designed to open the platform to a wider array of developers, including support for Linux and macOS, as well as additional open source libraries.</p>
<p>Microsoft announced the Quantum Development Kit at its Ignite conference last fall. It launched the free preview about three months later, featuring the new Q# programming language, deep integration with Visual Studio, and a quantum simulator, noted Jeff Henshaw, group program manager for quantum software at Microsoft, in an online post.</p>
<h3>Python Interoperability</h3>
<p>Developers have been clamoring for the kit to be made available for Linux and macOS, according to Microsoft."Specifically, QDK support for Mac and Linux-based development has been our No. 1 requested feature from developers," said Scott Friedman, a spokesperson for Microsoft.</p>
<h3>Developer Demand</h3>
<p>There have been tens of thousands of downloads of the kit since its introduction, Microsoft said, with users ranging from students and professors to researchers, algorithm designers and those new to quantum computing.</p>
<p>"This is all about making it easier for the developer ecosystem to embrace quantum computing," said Ashish Nadkarni, programming vice president for computing platforms at IDC.</p>
<p>To a large extent, quantum computing requires the use of code, he told LinuxInsider, and developers increasingly have been using Linux and Python to write pieces of code. Many have been using macOS as their platform for virtual machines.</p>

<h3>Rival Systems</h3>
<p>The most significant change from Microsoft may be the increase in speed of its quantum simulator, said Paul Teich, principal analyst at Tirias Research.</p>
<p>Its performance is now four to five times faster, he told LinuxInsider, which permits a much faster testing and optimization loop, particularly on simulations involving 20 or more qubits.</p>
<p>IBM last fall announced two major upgrades to its IBM-Q commercial systems, including a 20-qubit system available to clients and a prototype 50-qubit system that will become available with the next-generation IBM-Q systems.</p>
<p>IBM rolled out its open source QISKit earlier last year, making quantum computers available to run programs on hardware or online quantum simulators.</p>

<li><h2>Oracle to Leverage AI, Machine Learning in Autonomous Cloud Platform</h2></li>
<p>Oracle on Tuesday demonstrated artificial intelligence and machine learning advances in the Oracle Cloud Platform at Oracle CloudWorld in New York.</p>
<p>Autonomous capabilities for application development, mobile and bots, integration, analytics, security and system management are scheduled for availability in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Oracle announced a slew of new Platform as a Service features and capabilities, including the following:</p>
<h3>The Oracle Digital Assistant</h3>
<p>Oracle also demonstrated an Oracle Digital Assistant, which will provide centralized communications across CRM, ERP, HCM, custom applications and business intelligence data.</p>
<p>The Assistant's cross-application capability "is the differentiator," said Holger Mueller, principal analyst at Constellation Research. However, "I'm skeptical," he told the E-Commerce Times, "as no neural network has been announced by Oracle."</p>
<p>Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM "haven't exactly been Oracle's greatest fans over the years," Enderle pointed out. "I think the promise is massively ahead of reality here."</p>

<h3>Leg Up or Tall Story?</h3>
<p>"An autonomous Oracle is truly ahead of everybody," observed Constellation Research's Mueller. "This announcement now fleshes out the autonomous database, which had gaps in security and the risk of old code."</p>
<p>However, overall, Oracle's announcement "reads like a whopper," Enderle said."Folks forget that Oracle is famous for making claims they have capabilities long before they actually have them."</p>
<p>Delivering on its autonomous cloud promise "would require massive capabilities Oracle has yet to demonstrate in data centers that haven't been built yet," he added.</p>
<p>Further, Oracle's policy is to lock in customers, and "these efforts have high requirements for interoperability," Enderle said. Also, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM "have services that can do [the same thing but] they just aren't packaged as nicely."</p>
<p>Still, if successfully executed, he acknowledged that Oracle's plans "would be a massive boost" to its existing efforts in the targeted areas.</p>
