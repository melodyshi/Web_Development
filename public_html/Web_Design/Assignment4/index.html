    <li>VMware beats Wall Street expectations as reverse merger with Dell Technologies looms</li>
    <p>VMware parent Dell Technologies is considering a complicated reverse merger in which would combine
       the two companies in a single public entity. VMware shareholders were not impressed by the potential
      deal, which comes after weeks of trial balloons about possible combinations that would shake up the
      massive financial engineering project that is the Dell Technologies conglomerate.</p>

    <li>Researchers are figuring out how to pack a supercomputer into a nanosatallite</li>
    <p>Putting a supercomputer in a package that’s roughly the size of a loaf of bread is one thing.
      Making sure the supercomputer is radiation-hardened to survive the harsh conditions of space is quite another.
A team headquartered at the University of Pittsburgh is trying to do both, for an experiment that’s backed by
the Department of Defense, NASA and the National Science Foundation.</p>

    <li>With $13.5M boost, Astranis unveils big plan to beam internet from small satellites</li>
    <p>Astranis Space Technologies is taking the wraps off a plan to provide internet access to billions of
      people, using small-sized, low-cost satellites that are lofted into high-flying orbits.</p>

  <h3>Tech companies should stop pretending AI won’t destroy jobs</h3>
  <img src="Images/kaifuLee.jpg">
  <h4>A View from Kai-Fu Lee</h4>

  <p>Some people argue that it will take longer than we think before jobs disappear, since many jobs will
    be only partially replaced, and companies will try to redeploy those displaced internally. But even if true,
    that won’t stop the inevitable. Others remind us that every technology revolution has created new jobs as
    it displaced old ones. But it’s dangerous to assume this will be the case again.
  </p>

  <p>Then there are the symbiotic optimists, who think that AI combined with humans should be better than
    either one alone. This will be true for certain professions—doctors, lawyers—but most jobs won’t fall in
    that category. Instead they are routine, single-domain jobs where AI excels over the human by a large margin.
  </p>

  <p>Others think we’ll be saved by a universal basic income. “Take the extra money made by AI and distribute
    it to the people who lost their jobs,” they say. “This additional income will help people find their new path,
     and replace other types of social welfare.” But UBI doesn’t address people’s loss of dignity or meet their
     need to feel useful. It’s just a convenient way for a beneficiary of the AI revolution to sit back and do nothing.
  </p>

  <p>And finally, there are those who deny that AI has any downside at all—which is the position taken by many of
     the largest AI companies. It’s unfortunate that AI experts aren’t trying to solve the problem. What’s worse, and
    unbelievably selfish, is that they actually refuse to acknowledge the problem exists in the first place.
  </p>

  <p>These changes are coming, and we need to tell the truth and the whole truth. We need to find the jobs that AI
     can’t do and train people to do them. We need to reinvent education. These will be the best of times and the worst
     of times. If we act rationally and quickly, we can bask in what’s best rather than wallow in what’s worst.
